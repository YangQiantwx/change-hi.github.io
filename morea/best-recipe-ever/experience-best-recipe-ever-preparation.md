# 3. Prepare the best recipe ever

**Double Fried Chicken Preparation**

Marinate chicken pieces in buttermilk for at least 2 hours, then dredge in a mixture of flour, spices, and seasonings. Fry the chicken in vegetable oil until golden brown, then drain and fry a second time for extra crispiness.
