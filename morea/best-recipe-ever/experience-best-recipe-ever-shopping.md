# 2. Shop for the best recipe ever

*To create the ultimate fried chicken, gather these ten essential ingredients: chicken pieces, buttermilk, all-purpose flour, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, salt, black pepper, and vegetable oil. Most items can be found at your local grocery store in the poultry, dairy, baking, and spices sections. For a visual guide, look for images of fresh chicken, a bottle of buttermilk, and an array of vibrant spices.*
